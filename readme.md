The plan here is to create an API that can predit outcomes of games based on who's playing.
(ideally for ARAM but we might be able to use it anywhere)

Secondary option would provide user stats.  (I would like to take this further and set it up so it can also give you useful buildouts for things.)

I also want this to be responsive, and to work on a phone.  (Phonegap or JQ Mobile?)

I've utilized the inital API, but it looks like we're going to need to make several calls throughout the program.
